# Graphics Library

If you are reading this you probably are looking for some examples of David Ison's past work.  David worked at Group 42, Inc from 1995-1997 and was responsible for porting Image processing to Mac / PPC from Win32 / Intel. 

The PPC was a big endian CPU, X86 was little endian.

Something to keep in mind is - this C++ code was written in the mid-1990's.
(Before C++99, before there was version control, before Stack Overflow and web searches and the STL).  

These sources were maintained under an MSDOS 8.3 naming convention. (So the extensions are capitalised on case-sensitive filesystems)


David also contributed to various parts of this library:

- G42 Libraries/API 2.0/Image/g42pict.cpp - Mac OS Pict file reader and writer.
- /G42 Libraries/API 2.0/Include/g42sview.h & g42zview.h - Mac port of single image viewer 
- WebImage Object - Image Map Editor Application
- G42 Libraries/API 3.0/Common/INCLUDE/G42SWAPPER.H & .CPP - Memory manager
- G42 Libraries/API 3.0/Common/SOURCE/GSWAPTST.CPP - Automated tester for Memory Manager / Swapper
- G42 Libraries/API 3.0/Common/INCLUDE/G42SWAPPER.H - Mac OS support for Temporary Memory
