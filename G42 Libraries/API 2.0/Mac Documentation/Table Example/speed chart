This is a table of speeds for example.c for the images in the document table.htmlThe table is organized by tile size and total memory given the library,and reports back the time to load and the time to display.Here are some times for various choicesTile size 4096Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time        0.8       0.8     1.2     5.3Display Time    0.5       0.5     4.6     7.1Total Time       1.3       1.3     5.8   12.4Tile size 2048Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time        0.8      0.8      0.8   4.2Display Time    0.6      0.6     0.6   13.3Total Time       1.4      1.4     1.4   17.5Tile size 1024Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time           0.8    0.8     0.8     6.0Display Time       0.8    0.8     0.8   23.7Total Time          1.6    1.6     1.6   29.7Tile size 512Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time           0.9     0.9    0.9    11.6Display Time      1.4     1.4    1.4     38.3Total Time          2.3     2.3    2.3    49.9In summary, as the tile size goes down, the display timegoes up.  However, If you use small amounts of memory, youhave to keep tile sizes down so you can hold the images inas much of memory as possible.  Too small tiles can lead todrastically increased times as the tiles swap in and out.I suggest a tile size no smaller then 2048, perhaps 4096 wouldbe a better choice.  I would also suggest 512 KB of memory, if youcan provide that.  256 KB should be considered a minimum, and ifyou can't do 512, get as close to it as possible.  You will see speed increases with larger amounts of memory.  I used powers of 2 forboth tile size and memory, but you don't need to do that.  A tile sizeof 3000 works fine, as does a memory of 384 KB.
