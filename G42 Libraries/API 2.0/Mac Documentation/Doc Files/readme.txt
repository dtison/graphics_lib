readme.txt - image sdk 2.0 beta 5 6-27-96Note from Guy:>As far as I know, the only thing the library doesn't currently do>that the 1.0 did is progressive display.I am not 100% certain this note applies to the current library or not.  I needed to send the latest sources for the Image SDK with this example program.RE: The Image SDK 2.0 Example¥ You _may_ want to use the latest sources for your 1.0 -> 2.0 migration.  I still have to get back to the Mapper and test it with the latest sources,since I haven't been on it for awhile.¥ The alternative is to keep them separate for the time being.¥ In all likelihood you will need to set up some access paths in the project to find the library sources.  David Ison
