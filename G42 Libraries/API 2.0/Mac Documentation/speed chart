This is a table of speeds for example.c for the images in the document testimon.htmlThe table is organized by tile size and total memory given the library,and reports back the time to load and the time to display.This is how the old code workedTile Size 65528Memory Size    1024 KBLoad Time        17.75Display Time    6.25Total Time        24.00Here are some times for various choicesTile size 4096Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time        0.85    0.85   0.85   10.0Display Time    0.75    0.80   0.80   13.25Total Time       1.60    1.65   1.65   23.25Tile size 2048Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time        0.82    0.83   0.83   0.95Display Time    0.83    0.83   0.83   23.45Total Time       1.65    1.66   1.66   24.40Tile size 1024Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time        0.90    0.86   0.85   0.86Display Time    1.00    1.00   1.00   1.00Total Time       1.90    1.86   1.85    1.86Tile size 512Memory Size    1024   768    512   256Load Time        0.86    0.86   0.85   0.86Display Time    1.50    1.50   1.50   1.60Total Time       2.36    2.36   2.35    2.46In summary, as the tile size goes down, the display timegoes up.  However, If you use small amounts of memory, youhave to keep tile sizes down so you can hold the images inas much of memory as possible.  Note that this page doesn'thave large images (where 640 x 480 would be large), andlarge images with small tile sizes could cause displayspeed problems, so you may not want to get the tile size too small.
