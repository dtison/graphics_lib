Status Summary for SoftQuad [Mac] 1.0 -> 2.0 Migration ProjectThursday, 6-27-96¥  The documention has been enhanced to include a functions reference.  (This is called the "Documented API")¥  I sent the latest documentation in Word format, as well as the example program. (Via Email)¥  At this point, there should be no significant problem areas for Karl to get the changes implemented.  He sounded confident, and now I see the scope of what they want to do is fairly narrow and isn't too complicated [without scrolling and zooming of individual images], and also doesn't affect source code in zillions of places.¥  Looking ahead, the Mapper here is going to need some changes that Karl has already done on his end.  I anticipate doing these once he gets past the 1.0 -> 2.0 migration.
