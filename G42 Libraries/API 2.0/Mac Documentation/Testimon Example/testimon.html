Through our initialreview of publishers, we agreed that HoTMetaL was the choice software to developa site because of it's similarity to WordPerfect (with reveal codes turned on).It was during the developmental stages of our web site that our decision wasindeed the right one! Presently, our site is updated daily with current snowconditions with HoTMetaL and in the months ahead we plan on accessing HoTMetaLfor our site re-design.  Our site has received numerous complements from varioususers and definitely proved to be an valuable promotional &amp; sales tool.&quot;</I></P><P><B>Mark Rich</B> - Advertising &amp; Promotions Manager, Blue Mountain. Visit this web site at <A HREF="http://www.bluemountain.ca/">http://www.bluemountain.ca</A></P><P ALIGN="RIGHT"><A HREF="#Blue"><IMG SRC="uparrow.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="Strohl"><IMGSRC="turnwrld.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32"></A><I>&quot;AtCyberFORGE our focus is &quot; Information That Works&quot;.   Our Web siteproduction emphasis is quality product and rapid turn around.  Our clients haveseveral major concerns that we must routinely deal with, the most prominent ofwhich is having a clear sense that something is happening on their project. Many Web developers provide lots of warm fuzzy assurances up front, and thentake forever to produce actually viewable product. Using  HoTMetaL Pro we areable to develop Web CONTEXT structures quickly, using processes similar tosoftware rapid prototyping, allowing our customers to connect with the on-screenlook and feel in hours and days instead of weeks and months.  By using thesemethods in a HoTMetaL Pro environment, the client is able to support the CONTENTdevelopment process more effectively  resulting in fewer iterations and afaster, more effective market presence.  Other concerns frequently expressed arewhether we support the latest standards and enhancements of HTML and whether wecan convert material from other computing environments.  We are happy to be ableto respond that we not only support the latest standards but that ourdevelopment environment provides comprehensive standards checking for rigorouslycorrect HTML and provides all the advanced features, such as multiple formatimport and conversion, that a top of the line document development environmentwould.  The environment that accomplishes all this, naturally, is HoTMetaL Profor  the Macintosh.  We find it amusing to note the constant speculation in thepress about the capabilities and enhancements of several Johnny-come-lately HTMLdevelopment environments from big name software houses.  What is speculatedabout in regard to those software packages we are DOING TODAY with HoTMetaL Proon the Macintosh.  &quot;</I></P><P><B>John Strohl, Web Wizard</B>.

BeforeI had access to the product, I was simply typing up web pages as simple text onmy MAC, using mainly a Netscape 1.0 browser.  I had been writing HTML in thismode for about 4 months. HoTMetaL Pro made web page prep embarrassingly easier. More importantly, it showed me how flawed my pages were.  The browser issomewhat forgiving of several types of HTML code and masked errors I was makingconsistently.  HoTMetaL Pro was like a loving parent, gently indicating therewas a mistake on opening a page of mine, and even pointing to the problem area.(I found myself talking back to the machine, saying things like you won't findany mistakes now, etc.)  I've come to depend on it.  The MAC version which Ihave is consistent with usual MAC software &amp; protocol.  Thus I was able touse the product to prepare the web pages for the Kitchener-Waterloo SymphonyOrchestra without opening up the manual!  I find that HoTMetaL Pro software isat its best for me now in fine-tuning/updating pages. For this oft-repeatedexercise, I need something that is quick and easy to use,... but most of all,unerringly consistent!</I></P><P><B>Prof. Ian McGee</B>, University of Waterloo.

Unlike other products, HoTMetaLPro provides a sense of what the web pages will look like as you develop them -saving hours of tedious testing!  I recommend it to any serious web author. HoTMetaL Pro provides all the HTML rules for you.  This lets you focus oncontent, without struggling to remember how any particular HTML tag should becoded.  This feature really shortens web page development time.  The folks atSoftQuad put a new HTML rules file on their web site for clients to download - Igot the latest features without having to worry about calling anyone or dealingwith diskettes.

Their upgrade-able rules files make HoTMetaLPro the only visual web editor that moves with the quickly evolving HTMLstandards. When I had a problem with some of the newer Netscape 2.0 and Javatags, all I  had to do is call SoftQuad's tech support, and they sent me a newrules file via e-mail.
